# Angular2 Login front-end

Hello, this code allows users to select amongst different login methods. You are free to implement or change your own login methods
according to your needings.

The original code, created by Maximilian Schwarzmüller, and distributed through his courses,  used to connect to a Firebase account.

From there I started building my own code and adding functionalities.
